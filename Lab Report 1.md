##Examples with cd
![Image](3.png)
1. Now the working directory is "home". When put no arguments after cd, it appears and changes nothing. I believe it is not an error. but because I give cd no any directory, it just stay where it is.
2. Now the working directory is still "home". When I put directory "lecture1" after cd, the path showing the next line in the terminal changes to "[user@sahara ~/lecture1]" showing the working directory changed to lecture 1. Thus, it is not an error.
3. Now the working directory is "lecture1", when I put file "Hello.java" after cd, it reports an error that "bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory" because Hello.java is not a directory that it is not possible to be a working directory


##Examples with ls
![Image](1.png)
1. The working directory here is "lecture1". When I run ls in the command, it simply shows all the files and folders in "lecture1". Thus, it is not an error.
2. The working dirctory is "lecture1". When I run ls with dirctory "messages", it shows all the files inside of "messages". It is not an error.
3. The working dirctory is "lecture1". When I run ls with file "Hello.java", it just repeats the file name "Hello.java" because there is no file "inside" of "Hello.java" amd it just simply repeats the file name. It is not an error.
